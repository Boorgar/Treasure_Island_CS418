# Treasure Island
“Long John Silver's crew has committed mutiny and has him cornered and tied up! 
Round after round, they question him about the location of his treasure and explore the 
island following his directions — or perhaps his misdirections? Who knows... The old sea 
dog is surely planning an escape, after all, after which he will definitely try to get his 
treasure back.
Treasure Island is a game of bluffing and adventure in which one player embodies 
Long John, trying to mislead the others in their search for his treasure. The hunt reaches 
its climax with Long John's escape, when he will make a final run to get the booty for 
himself!!” (boardgamegeek.com)  
  
# Tasks
- Understand and implement the game rule.
- Implement a logical agent to walk around the map and scan for the treasure before 
the pirate is free and get it back. You don’t have to win the game, try your best to 
think about how you can make the agent decides what to do with information on 
the map, on the hints, on the movement of the pirate when he is trying to reach the 
treasure.
- Build a visualization tool to draw the action of the agent step-by-step.
